📘 Project Overview

This is my Power BI dashboard project focused on analyzing plant growth across also the role of sunlight, temperature, fertilizer, and watering in plant growth

I originally developed it as part of a virtual internship with TheSmartBridge, but I’ve since rebuilt it from scratch to reflect what I’d deliver in a real-world data analytics role — complete with optimized visuals, DAX-driven KPIs, region-based insights .

Through this dashboard, I aim to answer:

* Key conditions affecting plant growth • The role of sunlight, temperature, fertilizer, and watering • Comparative performance by categories

💡 Key Highlights

🔢 Growth Success KPI: it immediately shows overall performance.
🎯 Top Filters Aligned: Soil Type, Water Frequency, and Fertilizer Type slicers .
📈 scatter plot: Sunlight vs Temperature with Growth Outcome
🍩 Donut Chart: Average Environmental Conditions
🧠 Bar Chart: Growth_Milestone by Fertilizer_Type
🧱 treemap: Average Growth milestone with soil and fertilizer type
